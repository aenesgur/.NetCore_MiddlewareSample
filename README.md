# .NetCore_MiddlewareSample
Middleware, as its name suggests, is an intermediate layer. What we mean by the middleware is the structure that allows us to handle the process that passes in the web until a request turns into a response. In other words, it acts as an intermediate layer that allows us to intervene between request and response.
Middleware objects are defined in the "Configure" method in the "Startup.cs" file in our project.
